      <h2> The Programming Of This Website #1 </h2>
       I began programming this website the same day I revieved the questions for my
      exam in film studies, which I a week later found out was a bad Idea. When there were only two days
    left on the exam, I had written nothing.
    <br>
    <br>
    The website, however, it had code. Some of it I didn't even understand. More specifically
    the JavaScript, within the <a href="/weblog" class="intext">Weblog-page.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    As for the whole website, I drew big inital inspiration from the website <a href="https://sdomi.pl/" class="intext">sdomi.pl</a>, as you probably can see.
    I looked at some of the code and began to figure things out of my own, trying to learn the coding more and more.
    <br>
    <br>
    I had some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, but only limited. I had been somewhat interested in programming when I was little, but hadn't really worked on any big project.
    This is by far the biggest coding-project I have partaken. It was very fun. And at times, tidious. But definately rewarding.
