      <h2>Reading update 2023-08-10</h2>
      <p>Hi!

This is the first update and we are well into 2023.
During the 8-9 months since last time I have been doing other things, including forgetting about this blog of mine, and I have at least read a bit. Not thinking overly much how I planned my reading for the year, I have read some things that were not on that list. 7 books I'm counting so far, soon finished with my 8th.

Out of the inital 15 planned, I have read: 1.
Atomic Habits.
Isn't that ironic, in a way.
I wrote a review on that book after finishing it, but I never uploaded it. That might see the light of day some day.

The other 6 books I have read so far is
</p>
<ul>
	<li>1. Meno - Plato</li>
	<li>2. History of the future (Framtidens historia) - Henrik Brissman</li>
	<li>3. Heaven in Disorder - Slavoj Zizek</li>
	<li>4. Ludwig Wittgenstein: An introduciton - K.T. Fann</li>
	<li>5. The Twilight World - Werner Herzog</li>
	<li>6. The Bolovian Diary - Ernesto Che Guevara</li>
  </ul>
<p>
and the one I'm soon finished with is
</p>
<ul>
<li>	7. City of My Dreams (Mina drömmars stad) - Per Anders Fogelström</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have quite enojyed reading this year, which is appreciated.
I also read the first 100 pages of Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami but felt obliged to give my copy away to my cousin who would celebrate his 15th birthday on a roadtrip through Europe. (The protagoinst in the book runs away from home on his 15th birthday). Out of all the books I've read, including Kafka on the Shore, it's that one which I reccomend the most. After that The Bolivian Diary, and Heaven in Disorder after that. No book I read so far was bad.

But that's at least an update for you, but mostly for me. You see, after remebering I had this blog and why I coded it into existence to begin with, I realised that I should continue to use it.

As you'll see if I ever upload my Atomic Habits-review, perseverence, discipline, is supreme.
