      <h2>Blog update #1</h2>
      <p>I began programming this website the same day I revieved the questions for my
     exam in film studies, which I a week later found out was a bad Idea. When there were only two days
   left on the exam, I had written nothing.
   <br>
   <br>
   The website, however, it had code. Some of it I didn't even understand. More specifically
   the JavaScript, within the <a href="/weblog" class="intext">Weblog-page.</a>
   <br>
   <br>
   As for the whole website, I drew big inital inspiration from the website <a href="https://sdomi.pl/" class="intext">sdomi.pl</a>, as you probably can see.
   I looked at some of the code and began to figure things out of my own, trying to learn the coding more and more.
   <br>
   <br>
   I had some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, but only limited. I had been somewhat interested in programming when I was little, but hadn't really worked on any big project.
   This is by far the biggest coding-project I have partaken. It was very fun. And at times, tidious. But definately rewarding.</p>
